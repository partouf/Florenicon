Lists anyone in your vicinity who gains and loses a Druid's Efflorescence buff.

Efflorescence doesn't normally show up in your party- or raid-frames, while you might want to get some info on who's getting it, and perhaps even want to know if it's even doing its job.

This addon catches the healing done by Effloresence (meaning all druid's their Efflorescence beds), and displays wether there's any useful healing being done by colouring the text green and display the amount of healing it recently registered.
